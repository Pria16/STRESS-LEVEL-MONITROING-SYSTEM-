# STRESS-LEVEL-MONITROING-SYSTEM-
Problem Statement:
Stress is a major factor affecting human health, leading to physical and mental disorders such as anxiety, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Traditional stress measurement methods rely on self-reported data, which can be subjective and unreliable.
This project aims to develop an IoT-based stress level monitoring system that collects physiological and environmental parameters to determine stress levels. The system will integrate biomedical sensors with machine learning algorithms to provide real-time stress assessment.

Introduction:
Stress monitoring is crucial for maintaining overall well-being and enhancing productivity. By analysing physiological signals such as heart rate, blood oxygen level (SpO2), temperature, and humidity, stress levels can be effectively monitored.
This project leverages wearable sensors and machine learning techniques to provide an accurate stress assessment system. The system will continuously measure parameters and use cloud-based services for data storage and analysis.

Objective:
•	Develop a real-time stress monitoring system using IoT sensors.
•	Measure physiological parameters such as heart rate, SpO2, temperature, and humidity.
